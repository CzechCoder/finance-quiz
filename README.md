# Built on React + TypeScript + Vite

A buildable source code. This project is not a standard correct/wrong quiz but rather an evaluation of the answers the user provides.

The quiz works simply by starting it with a button on the intro screen and after answering a couple of questions, the user gets to the results page where they get to know in which fields their finances are strong or weak.
